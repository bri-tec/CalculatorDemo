# Calculator Demo (SOLID)

This is a demo project to show the use of SOLID programming techniques in use. Solid stands for:

S: Single Responsibility - A class should only have a single responsibility

O: Open-Closed Principle - The application should be open to extension, but closed to modification. This can be done with interfaces or abstract classes, and by using delegate methods.

L: Liskov Substitution Principle - You should be able to substitue a class for another class. This is done with Interfaces.

I: Interface Segregation Principle - Interfaces should be kept segregated for its intended use, and mutiple interfaces should be used if extra functionality is needed.

D: Dependency Inversion - Using interfaces or abstract classes instead of tight links to concreate classes, classes should be created at a high level and passed down. In this example we have used a factory class.
